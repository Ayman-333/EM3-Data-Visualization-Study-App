# EM3 Data Visualization Study Application


In efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of a number of energy data visualizations from the perspective of the end-user, we have developed an app to showcase different kinds of energy data visualizations: conventional data visualizations and novel data visualizations. The app is also an interative questionnaire where you can rate different visualizations based on a number of criteria.

To the best of the our knowledge, this is the first framework, to date, that uses a novel interactive mobile application, developed from scratch using React Native, to display energy visualizations and conduct a survey on the impact of conventional and novel visualization plots for improving energy saving in buildings. We conducted the study in this manner to catch the user experience for these plots on the final destination, which is a mobile application.

A set of novel smart energy usage visualizations are created/introduced, including heatmap chart, stacked bar chart, and spiral chart, which provide more options to present energy consumption data than conventional visualizations, which include line graph, bar chart, and stacked area chart. Once the participant completes the questionnaire, his/her response is stored on Firebase online NoSQL database, namely Firestore.
